## DEMOS

- StackBlitz - [JavaScript Promises](https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-sznnwr)

- StackBlitz - [RxJS Observables](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-observables)

## Training

### Training 1: Using `Promise` to fetch data from an API endpoint

---

Create a component that uses `Promise` to fetch data from an API
endpoint. Write a function `getData()` that returns a Promise that
resolves your data. Write a function `handleData()` that takes the
resolved value from the Promise and logs it to the console.
Call the `getData()` function and chain a `.then()` method to it, 
passing handleData as the callback function. Repeat the process and 
use `.catch()` to handle any errors. Rewrite you code using `async/await`.


### Training 2: Using `Observable` to fetch data from an API endpoint

---

Rewrite your previous code to use `Observable` instead of `Promise`.
